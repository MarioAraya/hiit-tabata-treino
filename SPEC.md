# Tabata Hiit Timer with Music App

## Specs

An app with two timers, and a config page when I can configure both timers intervals and pauses.

1. Screen 1

- Must have a clickable Big Blue timer that starts in 12m 30s and goes down 1 sec until 0
- When 0 is reached, the timer changes color to Green and resets to 3min and starts going down automatically
- When the green clock is 0, the blue timer is showed again, but now is 4m 30s, and starts going down to 0

2. Screen 2

- Let me configure intervals of each timer
- Let me insert a link to a youtube song that will play when each clock starts
